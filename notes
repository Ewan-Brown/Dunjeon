What i was last doing:
Working on Monster AI.
    Raycasting isn't what i want it to be - it cuts off too much.
        Maybe try the corner idea? sum how many corners of square X are visible from corners of cell Y? get a 'percentage' visibility?
    Movements are processed immediately after AI is processed, so the visual display for sight will appear to lag.
        THis is ok.
