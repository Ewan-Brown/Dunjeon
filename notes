WIP/FIXING:
    There's some pretty serious performance issues, need to get some profiling data from the raycasting and the pathfinding stuff.
    Also, it seems that the player/monster can phase through eachother while moving. This should be removed.

    For the raytracing : can I 'slide' across the walls that I hit, as there's no reason to hit the same block 10 times.
        Maybe when a ray collides, we can slide across the wall and add tiny delta at the end to push it past the known
        collision spot.

Next Steps:
    Need to add more tasks for monster.
        Fight/Attack. Melee can be structured just like the interact action afaik.
        Sleep?

    Give monster ability to open door!

    Sound/Acoustic system
        Keep it simple stupid
