Theme idea : Play as some sort of Venom-like parasite that hops from entity to entity.

Spore scale.

First scale is the classic spore experience but as a tiny organism. Simple and deceiving.
When the player gets large enough they can infect people
    Fairly simple but fun
    Can be beaten quickly
Next stage is planets
    Complex, unclear objective but large world to interact with

Then idk

Create a shitty 3D solar viewer
This gives me opportunity to do land generation, nature/wildlife simulation, city gen etc.
This will take me foreever?

World should be randomly generated. Story is sentient species together living on planet.
link the background of this to the planet's generation.
One idea is Outcast planet with settlers and dangerous native life, very original nice.
Simple generation, can just be randomly placed towns

Generate NPC quotes with ML data
    Parse data from PDFs/txt of novels and single out quotations

Complex entity stats
    DF-like
    Entity health based off of sum of parts, no 'hp' counter.
    Each part has assigned roles and uses

3 types of combat
    Inherent Magick
        Like spells from Witcher
        Illusion
        Mind reading
        Mind control
        =Uses Player's Mana
            Regained by resting in places with high mana

    Physical
        Ranged
        Melee
        Works against almost all enemies
        Fairly predictable
    Artificial Magick ("Artifacts")
         Like noita wands
        =Limited usages
        =High risk/High reward


Instead of 'mana' being player centered, psionic energy can exist as a 'web' along the weird, where each cell is a node.
The 'mana web' observes basic fluid dynamics when it is used up at a node, slowly 'flooding it'. Sources are living creatures
Can think of mana as more of a gas consumed.

SOUND:

Maybe this is stupid but, take my audio clips, and do some fucky shit with the data. e.x take the data, FFT it at various parameters and recreate it with inverse FFT.
