WIP :
    WOrking on redoing the AI. using a finite state machine, started with 'Explore' task.
        This task should represent both Idle and Explore states, as they share many branches.
        A basic Explore-Idle state works. Need to do branching next. see IRL notes.

TO FIX:

    Entities can phase through eachother. Probably because their move actions are ending on the same tick

    For the raytracing : can I 'slide' across the walls that I hit? there's no reason to hit the same block 10 times.
        Maybe when a ray collides, we can slide across the wall and add tiny delta at the end to push it past the
        known collision spot.

    How to deal with task transitions? Where do they go, how do I handle cancellations and interruptions that should
    result in a given action? Can this case be avoided?
