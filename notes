WIP :
    Working on adding logic for when an entity dies. Check out Entity line 57 for some random starting point

TO FIX:

    For the raytracing : can I 'slide' across the walls that I hit? there's no reason to hit the same block 10 times.
        Maybe when a ray collides, we can slide across the wall and add tiny delta at the end to push it past the
        known collision spot.
