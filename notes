WIP :
    Working on figuring out inventory and item interactions... going to need to think this one through a fair amount.
    I've got it somewhat down. Leaving AI for later, that should be a secondary layer to things, shouldn't be item dependant.
    Items Will have 'Uses' attached to them for certain actions. Each item should for now only have one melee, cast, use.
    IF the item has a usage to match the action, said action is performed using logic from the 'use'.
    Allows easy sharing of 'use' between very different items (e.x bash with crossbow vs bash with Big Stick should function the same.)
    This may also be useful for AI.

TO FIX:

    For the raytracing : can I 'slide' across the walls that I hit? there's no reason to hit the same block 10 times.
        Maybe when a ray collides, we can slide across the wall and add tiny delta at the end to push it past the
        known collision spot.
